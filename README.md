# unit-4-game
simple math game using jQuery

**Game Instructions**

You will be given a different target number at the start of each game. Click the crystals to add a specific amount of points to your number. Win the game by matching your number to the target number; you lose if your number is higher than the target number. For each game, the crystals have a different hidden value. *sounds easy right? well... it is easy.* -Tyler
