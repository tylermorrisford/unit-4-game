# unit-4-game
simple math game using jQuery

**How it Works**
On the document.ready event, a target number (between 19 and 120) is chosen randomly, and each of four crystals is assigned a random number between 1 and 12. Click events add that assigned number to a user score. The game logic compares the target number with the user score; if the user score exceeds the target number, the game is lost, and the number of losses is incremented. If the user score matches the target number, the game is won! In either scenario, the game resets (without resetting the number of wins/losses), which chooses another target number randomly, and assigns four new random numbers to the crystals. 

**Game Instructions**

You will be given a different target number at the start of each game. Click the crystals to add a specific amount of points to your number. Win the game by matching your number to the target number; you lose if your number is higher than the target number. For each game, the crystals have a different hidden value. *sounds easy right? well... it is easy.* -Tyler
